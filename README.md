PARRHI
Parametrizable Augmented Reality for Robot-Human Interaction

The goal of this framework/project is to lower the cost of AR-application development in an industrial context.
The application logic can be "programmed" in XML by un-experienced programmers (or by using a graphical XML editor) and the engine then executes the application in AR, while handling everything necessary for the communication with the robot and the Augmented Reality world.
