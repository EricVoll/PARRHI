\chapter{Concept}\label{Chap:Concept}

\section{Basic Overview}
To solve the stated problems (see section \ref{Section:ProblemDescription}) the to be implemented system from now on called Parametrised Augmented Reality Robot Human Interface (PARRHI) will have to fulfil these (very abstract) requirements:
\begin{itemize}
	\setlength\itemsep{-1em}
	\item Allow development of AR-HR Interfaces without knowledge in programming	
	\item Provide means to document the application's workflow
	\item Allow previous work to be reused
\end{itemize}



\section{V-Model}
To pinpoint the exact system requirements the V-Model is applied. 

Questions/Ideas:
\begin{enumerate}
	\setcounter{enumi}{0}
	\setlength\itemsep{-2em}
	\item I could write down some "User-Stories" 
	\item Or write down some Use-Cases
	\item When do I start to get technical? (System I/O diagrams)
	\item Does the V-Model belong to the concept or is it implementation already?
	\item Is it ok to call the system PARRHI throughout the thesis?
\end{enumerate}
