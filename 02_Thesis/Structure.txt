Thesis structure:

1.) Introduction
1.1) Reasons for- and problems with Human-Robot collaboration
 - Describe current problems in the robotics industry (robot communication, dev-shortage)
1.2) Parametrised development as an approach to solve AR-developer shortage
 - Short explanation of what this thesis is about (solve problems from 1.1 via parametrisation)

2.) State of the Art
 - How and why will I explain exactly these technologies/principles
2.1) Augmented Reality and its standardisations
 - ...
2.2) AR in Robotic applications
2.2.1) AR during development and testing
 - ...
2.2.2) Operating robotic systems with AR support
 - ...
2.3) Parametrised Development
 - Parametrised Dev in other industries (electrical engineering CAD and architecture)
2.4) Current methods programming industrial robots
 - ...
2.5) parametrised AR in Robotic applications
 - Bring together the advanteges of the previous chapters and derive the principle of PARRHI

3) Concept
3.1) Goal and Requirements
 - Goal: What exactly do I want to achieve with PARRHI? (Bullet points)
3.1.1) User Requirements
 - What are the user's requirements to achive the goal? (Bullet points)
3.1.2) System Requirements
 - What are the system's (PARRHI's) requirements to fulfil the user requirements? (Bullet points)
[This strucure is based on the "V-Modell". A Vorgehensmodell, which is loved by my institute]
3.1.3) Example Use-Cases
3.2) PARRHI Concept 
 - Introduction: Super general overview "Left -> Dev, Middle -> System, Right -> AR/Real World"
 - Concept Picture
 - Explain the components
  - Explain "Parameters" while explaining Parametrised Program or the "real world model"
 - Explain the Information/Work flow between the components
  (- Includes: Interaction between AR and Real World)

[The following chapters will explain each component very detailled]
3.2.1) Preparation of Parameters
 - Collecting data through sensors, processing them via models, extracting parameters about real world
3.2.2) Parametrised Program
 - Explain structure and program componentes in detail
 - How does each component use parameters and act as a parameter for other components
3.2.2.1) Variables
3.2.2.2) Points
3.2.2.3) Holograms
3.2.2.4) Events
3.2.3) Core Routine
 - The actual routine that interprets the "Parametrised Program" with its parameters
3.2.4) I/O Modules
 - How does PARRHI communicate with the robot
 - How does PARRHI communicate with the AR space
 - How does PARRHI collect data for the parameter preperation

4) Implementation
4.1) XML/XSD structure and generator 
4.2) Unity	
4.2.1) Image tracking
4.2.2) AR-Toolkit
